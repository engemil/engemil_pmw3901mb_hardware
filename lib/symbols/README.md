# Symbols Folder

Symbols are stored all together in one `.kicad_sym`-file. For simple project (like this one) it make sense to gather all symbols into one file.

To add new symbols to the project symbol library:
- Open **Symbol Editor**
- (If you are making a new library) Go to **File** and **New Library...**
- Select your library in the **Library Tree** (list of libraries on the left side).
    - In our case it is `engemil_pmw3901mb_module_symbol_library.kicad_sym`
- Right click and choose **Import Symbol...**
- Choose the `.kicad_sym` file for the new symbol
