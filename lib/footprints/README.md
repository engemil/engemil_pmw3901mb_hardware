# Footprints Folder

Footprints are stored together into `.pretty`-folders. For simple project (like this one) it make sense to gather all symbols into only one `.pretty`-folder.

To add new footprint to the project footprint library:
- Save the footprint(s) under the `.pretty`-folder
- When you are placing a componented in **Schematic Editor**. Remember to choose the imported footprint while in the **Choose Symbol**-window.
